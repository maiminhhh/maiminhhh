# **Evaluation of a potentially optimal location for an official store in Sydney**

### Project 3

### University of Sydney \| Foundation of Data Science \| May 2023

## Client

### [**Dear Klairs**](https://www.klairscosmetics.com)

-   A Korean skincare brand established in 2010
-   Currently has 1,000 distribution channels in 40 countries
-   Aims at becoming a global brand

## Recommendations

-   The proximity of light rail stations is a reasonable location for Dear Klairs' official store in Sydney.
-   Light rail stations in the middle of the Sydney light rail network appears to be the best option.
-   The second and third best choices are those in the Eastern and Western part of the network, respectively.

### [The Data](https://opendata.transport.nsw.gov.au/dataset/opal-trips-light-rail)

-   47 light rail stations from opendata.transport.nsw.gov.au, with 3 variables in consideration:
    -   Month and Year recorded
    -   Name of the light rail stations
    -   Trips
-   Closed light rail stations were excluded, considering only the stations which are currently operated

### Is the number of people accessing light rail affected by the temperature?

###################### *Table 1: Welch's Test on The difference between Average Light Rail Trips in Low and High Temperature*

####  {.tabset}

##### Analysis

-   Based on the data about [weather averages by month in Sydney](https://en.climate-data.org/oceania/australia/new-south-wales/sydney-24/#:~:text=Data%20and%20graphs%20for%20weather%20%26%20climate&text=The%20rainfall%20in%20Sydney%20is,mm%20%7C%2035.9%20inch%20per%20year), the given data set is separated concerning the reported month of each object. Specifically, April, May, June, July, August, and October are considered low-temperature months, and the remaining are high-temperature.
-   A Welch's Test was then performed to verify whether there is any difference between warm and cool months in their average light rail trips, with a p-value \< 0.05 recognized as statistically significant.
-   Regarding the result shown in Table 1, it seems evidence that, with a significant p-value of approximately 0.89, the temperature only has a negligible effect on the number of people travelling by light rail.
-   Therefore, a store located near a light rail station appears to have a stable presence to the public.

##### Technical Notes

-   Hypothesis:
    -   H~0~: warm months' average light rail trips - cold months' average light rail trips = 0
    -   H~1~: warm months' average light rail trips - cold months' average light rail trips â‰  0
-   Significance level: 0.05
-   p-value: 0.89 \> 0.05

-\> H~0~ is retained

### Which part of the light rail network in Sydney is the most crowded?

-   The light rail network in Sydney is divided into three parts: Western, Central, and Eastern as demonstrated in Figure 1.

-   As can be observed in Figure 2, light rail stations in all regions experienced a similar trend from January 2020 to the end of 2022.
-   However, regardless of the changing pattern, light rail stations in the center remain to be the most crowded, with the average trips almost triple that of the counterpart in the East - the second most crowded area - in December 2022. By contrast, the Western side of the system saw the smallest number of people during the period examined.\
-   Hence, the Central, Eastern, and Western light rail stations appear to be the first, second, and third best choices for an official store regarding brand awareness.

### Client

Dear, Klairs aims to become a global skincare brand but has only one distributor in Sydney. Regarding their target, I believe they would love to have a store location that could maximize their brand awareness, thus making them a potential client for my research. Considering Dear, Klairs as my client, I have provided evidence on the stable access to Sydney light rail stations, which seems unreadily available for such a Korean brand. I have also utilized less technical language in this report to make it understandable for this cosmetic firm.

### Statistical Analytics

-   Welch's Test is utilized because:

    -   The variance test in Table 2 demonstrated that the average light rail trips during cold and warm months have equal spreads.

    ```{r message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
    tbl1 <- BasicTable$new()
    vary <- var.test(df_warm$avg_trips, df_cold$avg_trips)
    p_vary <- round(vary$p.value, 2)

    ###################### *Table 2: Variance Test on the Spread of the Average Light Rail Trips in Cold and Warm months*

    -   The number of people accessing light rail during cold seasons does not affect their warm-season counterparts and vice versa.
    -   Due to the Central Limit Theorem, the distribution is normal in both cold and warm months.

-   A line graph is suitable for comparing objects through a period of time.

### Limitations

-   Inconsistent tapping behaviors could lead to the incompleteness of the data.
-   The actual daily temperature might be inconsistent with the assumed monthly average temperature.
