## 🚀 Overview

This project showcases my ability to clean, structure, and explore complex real-world data. The dataset — a subset of the **Australian Health Survey (AHS)** — simulates challenges often faced in industry: messy inputs, inconsistent formats, metadata embedded in external Excel sheets, and custom logic for missing values.

### ✅ Objectives:
- Clean and validate biomedical, nutrient, and food diary data
- Integrate disparate sources using subject and household identifiers
- Diagnose missingness and document handling strategies
- Deliver tidy, analysis-ready datasets for further modeling

## 📦 Dataset Summary

| File                         | Description                              |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `AHS11biomedical.csv`        | Biomedical indicators per individual     |
| `AHS11nutrient.csv`          | Nutrient intake estimates                |
| `AHS11food.csv`              | Two-day food diary records               |
| `nutmstatDataItems2019.xlsx` | External data dictionary + variable types|

**Identifiers:**
- `ABSPID`: Unique person ID (primary key across datasets)
- `ABSHID`: Household ID (for grouping by household)

## 🛠 Cleaning Strategy

Built using a **modular R pipeline**, the cleaning workflow includes:
- Variable typing and labeling with external metadata
- Standardized treatment of **special missing value codes**
- Merge and join logic preserving one-to-many food diary entries
- Documentation of every transformation for full reproducibility

The final cleaned data is saved as:
- `clean_data.Rdata` – For direct loading
- `clean_data_summary.html` – For exploratory reporting
