This project explores how gene expression data can be used to understand and predict kidney transplant outcomes. It demonstrates a complete data science workflow—from raw bioinformatics data to interpretable models supporting clinical decision-making.

## 🔍 Part 1 – Biopsy-Based Analysis (GSE57387)
- Identified differentially expressed genes linked to graft damage at 3 and 12 months post-transplant (via CADI scores).
- Performed log-transformation, normalization, and **moderated t-tests** using `limma`.
- Designed visual comparisons between early and late damage patterns to support biological interpretation.

## 🧪 Part 2 – Blood-Based Classification (GSE46474)
- Built ML models (Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression) to classify transplant damage using blood samples.
- Evaluated performance using **nested cross-validation**, AUC, and accuracy metrics.
- Compared CADI-3 vs CADI-12 as clinical endpoints, identifying the more stable outcome for future modeling.
