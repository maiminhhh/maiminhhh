## ðŸŽ“ University Projects & Coursework Portfolio

Welcome to maiminhhh's GitHub! This repository serves as a collection of my academic work during my time at university. It includes projects, assignments, and personal explorations across data science, finance, programming, and machine learning.
You'll find code and documentation related to:

- Data analysis & visualization (R, Python, tidyverse, ggplot2, pandas, matplotlib)
- Machine learning models and experiments (scikit-learn, TensorFlow, CNNs)
- Statistical modeling & simulations
- Algorithms and data structures
- Capstone and group project collaborations

Each repository contains a brief README to explain the objective, methodology, and key learnings. This portfolio reflects my progression, curiosity, and problem-solving skills throughout my degree.
