## 🧬 Kidney Transplant Damage Prediction Using Gene Expression Data  
**Datasets: GSE57387 (biopsy) & GSE46474 (blood)**

This project explores the use of gene expression data to understand and predict kidney transplant outcomes, using two publicly available clinical datasets. It demonstrates my ability to work across the full data science pipeline—from raw biomedical data to actionable insights for healthcare applications.

### 🔍 Part 1 – Biopsy-Based Analysis (GSE57387)
- Performed **differential expression analysis** to identify genes associated with graft damage at 3 and 12 months post-transplant (CADI scores).
- Applied **moderated t-tests using limma**, and used **data filtering, log-transformation, and normalization** to ensure robust comparisons.
- Designed **visual summaries** to compare early and late damage signals, helping clinicians understand gene-level drivers of long-term rejection.

### 🧪 Part 2 – Blood-Based Classification (GSE46474)
- Built predictive models (Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression) using blood gene expression to classify kidney transplant damage.
- Evaluated models using **nested cross-validation** and metrics like AUC to ensure reliable performance.
- Compared models using CADI-3 and CADI-12 as targets, and recommended the most stable and informative response variable for clinical use.
