# 🏡 Sydney Housing Market — Interactive Map (Advanced Cohort Project)

This repository contains my contribution to a **group project** completed as part of the **advanced cohort** in [Course/Unit Name], focusing on the **Sydney housing market**.

> 📌 This GitHub repo includes **only my individual component**, which involves generating an **interactive map** of Sydney property data using the `leaflet` package in R.

## 💡 Project Context

Our team investigated various factors affecting **house prices in Sydney**, including location, proximity to services, and socioeconomic indicators. The goal was to uncover spatial patterns and insights relevant to urban planning and housing affordability.

## 🗺️ My Contribution: Interactive Map with Leaflet

I developed an interactive web-based map using the `leaflet` package in R to visualize housing data geospatially.

### 🔧 Features of the Map:
- **Dynamic markers** for each property, with tooltips showing key details (e.g., price, suburb, property type).
- **Color-coded markers** or layers based on pricing categories or other attributes.
- **Zoom and pan functionality** for seamless exploration across Greater Sydney.
- Potential for extension with layers such as public transport, schools, or crime statistics.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- `R`
- `leaflet`
- `dplyr`
- `readr`

## 📁 Files Included
- `Project 2.rmd`: Main R script generating the leaflet map.
- `properties_v2.csv`: Sample dataset.
- `Project-2.html`: Knitted html file of the interactive map
- `README.md`: This file.

## 🔍 Notes
- This map is part of a **larger collaborative analysis**. Full team results and final report are **not included** in this repo, per academic policy.
- For privacy and data licensing reasons, sensitive data has been either anonymized or excluded.
